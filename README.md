# Jargonstein

![](public/Assets/jargonstein-landing-page.png)

An app that randomly displays a jargon and related news mentions.

The app uses seed data of jargons cobbled together from various sources. It uses the api provided by https://newsapi.org/ to retrieve news mentions related to a jargon.

More than being a complete app, therefore, this is an attempt to practise and incorporate fundamental concepts related to the following themes:

* React development
  * Stateful parent and stateless functional components
  * PropTypes
  * Modularity
  * Routing
* Heroku deployment
* Testing
* Javascript coding and refactoring
* CSS

This app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
